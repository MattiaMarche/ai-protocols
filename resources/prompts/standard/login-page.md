# Login page

Create a login page using React. The page should include two fields: one for email and one for password. 

- The email field must validate that the input is in a proper email format.
- The password field must enforce a minimum length of 8 characters.
- If the inputs are invalid, display appropriate error messages to the user.
- Use a simple, centered layout for the form.
